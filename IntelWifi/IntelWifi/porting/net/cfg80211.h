 * DOC: Scanning and BSS list handling
 *
 * The scanning process itself is fairly simple, but cfg80211 offers quite
 * a bit of helper functionality. To start a scan, the scan operation will
 * be invoked with a scan definition. This scan definition contains the
 * channels to scan, and the SSIDs to send probe requests for (including the
 * wildcard, if desired). A passive scan is indicated by having no SSIDs to
 * probe. Additionally, a scan request may contain extra information elements
 * that should be added to the probe request. The IEs are guaranteed to be
 * well-formed, and will not exceed the maximum length the driver advertised
 * in the wiphy structure.
 *
 * When scanning finds a BSS, cfg80211 needs to be notified of that, because
 * it is responsible for maintaining the BSS list; the driver should not
 * maintain a list itself. For this notification, various functions exist.
 *
 * Since drivers do not maintain a BSS list, there are also a number of
 * functions to search for a BSS and obtain information about it from the
 * BSS structure cfg80211 maintains. The BSS list is also made available
 * to userspace.

 *    transmitted through nl80211, points to an array indexed by interface

 * @max_remain_on_channel_duration: Maximum time a remain-on-channel operation
 *    may request, if implemented.
 *
 * @wowlan: WoWLAN support information

 * @ht_capa_mod_mask:  Specify what ht_cap values can be over-ridden.

 *
 * @max_acl_mac_addrs: Maximum number of MAC addresses that the device
 *    supports for ACL.
 *
 * @extended_capabilities: extended capabilities supported by the driver,
 *    additional capabilities might be supported by userspace; these are
 *    the 802.11 extended capabilities ("Extended Capabilities element")
 *    and are in the same format as in the information element. See
 *    802.11-2012 8.4.2.29 for the defined fields. These are the default

 *    for a specific interface type in iftype_ext_capab.

 * @n_vendor_events: number of vendor events
 *
 * @max_ap_assoc_sta: maximum number of associated stations supported in AP mode
 *    (including P2P GO) or 0 to indicate no such limit is advertised. The
 *    driver is allowed to advertise a theoretical limit that it can reach in
 *    some cases, but may not always reach.
 *
 * @max_num_csa_counters: Number of supported csa_counters in beacons
 *    and probe responses.  This value should be set if the driver
 *    wishes to limit the number of csa counters. Default (0) means
 *    infinite.
 * @max_adj_channel_rssi_comp: max offset of between the channel on which the
 *    frame was sent and the channel on which the frame was heard for which
 *    the reported rssi is still valid. If a driver is able to compensate the
 *    low rssi when a frame is heard on different channel, then it should set
 *    this variable to the maximal offset for which it can compensate.
 *    This value should be set in MHz.
 * @bss_select_support: bitmask indicating the BSS selection criteria supported
 *    by the driver in the .connect() callback. The bit position maps to the
 *    attribute indices defined in &enum nl80211_bss_select_attr.
 *
 * @cookie_counter: unique generic cookie counter, used to identify objects.
 * @nan_supported_bands: bands supported by the device in NAN mode, a
 *    bitmap of &enum nl80211_band values.  For instance, for
 *    NL80211_BAND_2GHZ, bit 0 would be set
 *    (i.e. BIT(NL80211_BAND_2GHZ)).
